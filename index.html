            I have never seen the real world... now you may be wondering what I mean by this. My house is trapped in a dome and I have never seen the real world. I've seen the outside of my house and I've been out there multiple times to walk but never the real world. My parents still think that I don't know about the real world but I overheard them talking one night. *FLASHBACK* It was 11 P.M. and I was asleep until I woke up because I needed to go to the bathroom. I got up and went but when I was walking back to my room, I overheard my dad talking to my mom. My dad said," Well we're to far in, how is he ever going to see the real world, IS THIS EVEN LEGAL?!". Mom then said," He isn't". Dad said," There's a whole world out there, you don't think he'll ever find out, he should be living a normal life, sure there's danger in the world but there's also a lot of really good things." Mom then said,"HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN WHAT HAPPENED TO US! WE COULD OF DIED." I couldn't listen to anymore of this, I just went back to my room, and tried to sleep. *PRESENT DAY* I don't know what to do, ever since that night I've been lost.The night I heard that I had a nightmare that I asked my mom about it and she abandoned me into the world and it was horrible. Now I'm a superstitious person and I'm very afraid of the world but there's still a chance that the world is actually good. I haven't introduced myself, my name is Harry and I'm currently 12 years old.  *SWITCHES OVER TO NEIGHBORS OF HARRY* I've always known harry but now everyone on the block just calls him the dome kid. There have been a few kids saying that they want to break him out of there. *SWITCHES BACK TO HARRY* It's currently 9 P.M. so i will probably go to sleep soon. *1 HOUR LATER* I woke up to something scratching my window and then I looked outside and there was a group of kids. There was 3 kids. I opened the window and they said," We have to get you out of here." I then said," What are you talking about, who are you, why should I trust you." I had no idea who these kids were but somehow they got into the dome. The window was fairly tall so I jumped out with them and I realized it was cold. I didn't know why because it was never cold in here since we were separated from outside. The only time that I got sunlight was at 1 P.M. when the dome top opens up so I could get some sunlight. I went back in and tried to find something else to wear since it was cold out but then one of the kids handed me a jacket. I went back outside and saw that there was a hole in the dome and that was the reason it was cold. I looked outside and I saw a house. They told me that they wanted to break me out since I was stuck here and they didn't know if my parents were doing something bad to me. I told them I was fine and that they never did anything bad to me. They told me to follow them so I did and what I saw, was magnificent. It was dark out but I... I could see mountains and all these beautiful things I"ve never seen before. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, all this time my parents were hiding me from this for absolutely no reason. I was mad at them but then I heard my parents waking up. I didn't know what to do so they just grabbed my arm and they pulled me to the house next to ours. I was still in shock for all the things I saw but then we went into the house and they locked the door very quietly because one of the kids lived there and people were asleep. We spent a few minutes resting then we heard a knock at the door. One of the kids looked through the peephole and told me to look through. It was my parents and they continued to knock and we were worried someone would wake up and see us when we saw someone's light turn on so we went through the back door. There was a brick wall blocking us from jumping out of the house to the house behind us but we were able to jump it by getting on top of things and it was easy to jump out of there house to get onto the street.*THE NEXT DAY* I was in my bed wondering what had happened all night and my parents didn't even know what had happened. I had to tell them but I didn't know how. *THE NIGHT BEFORE* The kids said that since I had probably never seen anything other than my house, they wanted to show me some things. First we went to fairly close to the mountain and they told me the legends of what has happened in this mountain. I was really excited and really liked the legends then they took me to one of the kids houses. His parents were gone for some reason so he turned on his Xbox 1 and gave me a control. I had already known about this from a magazine, but never actually experienced it and it was a lot of fun. He had multiple controllers so we all played. They were all around my age so we all got along. The night was almost over but then they had one more place to show me. While we were talking through the night, I said I really enjoyed a good book. They showed me a library and I loved it. The idea of just being able to rent these books for free enthralled me. Eventually they took me back to the dome but my parents were near here so they snuck me in and I fell asleep. *THE MORNING* I couldn't believe what had happened the night before but I really enjoyed it. I looked out the window and saw the dome was repaired. I was puzzled. I knew it wasn't a dream but how. I could tell me parents were confused but they just didn't mention it to me. *THE NEXT DAY* I was in my bed wondering what had happened 2 nights ago and my parents didn't even know what had happened. I had to tell them but I didn't know how. I decided just to confront them and they were shocked. They then went on to explain what had happened to them and why they wanted to be separated from the world. I was shocked at what they said but I argued that the world could be a really good place too. They agreed that they would take the dome down. *ONE YEAR LATER* It's now been one year since the whole dome incident went down. I am very happy now and I am friends with all the ones that helped me but I'm planning on doing something to make it up to them because in the end, they changed my entire life!
